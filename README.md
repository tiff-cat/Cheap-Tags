# Cheap-Tags
This was a group project with three other people.  
We made a photo managing application where users can import photos, and organize them by adding tags. Users can import photos from local directories, Instagram, or Tumblr. Images can be organized by adding and removing tags, and searching by name on a regex search bar. Images can be reuploaded to Instagram with a caption that will feature the added tags.

This project features Java, JavaFX, REST API, regex, and git.
